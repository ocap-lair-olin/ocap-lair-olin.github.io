The robot went through a few stages of testing before the final test day out in the Charles River. We checked the robots thrusters, code, and buoyancy in a smaller pool on campus. After running these smaller checks and confirming the robot was ready to go, we had our final test day at the Charles. The robot was deployed successfully, with the only issue being a tempermental temperature sensor. The robot could sink and return to the surface, sat upright in the water, and was slightly positively buoyant, which is important for recovering the robot if it loses power. The robot knew what depth it was at, could move up and down between set depths, and could hover at one spot. The robot still has some improvements that can be made, but test day was a complete success.
