*2021-2022*

I am a Mechanical Engineering major, and am also interested in design and zoology. I mainly helped with the design and fabrication of the physical parts of the robot, such as the racks inside the tubes and the tube clamps. I got into this project because I was interested in improving my prototyping skills, working on a team, and learning more about aquaculture and underwater robotics. I offered to SCUBA dive with the robot during testing, but was turned down because I would be a liability.

*2022*

My intended major is Engineering: Sustainability, but I also have a strong interest in Robotics and programming. My future plans are to combine my interests in sustainabilty and robotics to create innovative technological solutions to agricultural and marine problems. I joined this project to gain experience doing hands-on robotics and sustainability work. In addition, I took an interest in this project due to my connection to Downeast Maine, where aquaculture is a growing industry and topic of conversation. My work on this project has consisted of electrical/sensing design and assembly, research into the sustainability-related applications of our robot, and some programming.

*2022*

I intend to major in Mechanical Engineering, but have a strong interest in Robotics, which is the field I want to get involved with after graduation. I joined this project so that I could gain experience in prototyping and fabrication for robotics-related projects. I have mainly been helping with the mechanical side of the project.

*2020-2021*

I graduated in 2022 with a degree in Engineering with a concentration in robotics. I am interested in perception, control, and automation. On the aquaculture project I explored the feasability of using computer vision to monitor key data such as growth rates, biomass, and pen populations. I also helped design, build, and test the profiler's preliminary electrical and software systems.
